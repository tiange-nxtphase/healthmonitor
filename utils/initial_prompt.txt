2.	Personalized Reports:
•	For each biomarker:
•	Provide the user’s result
•	Explain what the result means.
•	Compare the user’s results to the risk range below:
Category	Biomarker	Units	 	Optimal Range	Normal Range	Elevated Risk Range	High-Risk Range
		 		 		First Range	Second Range	 		 
 	 	 	 	Lower Limit	Upper Limit	Lower Limit	Upper Limit	Lower Limit	Upper Limit	Lower Limit	Upper Limit

•	Provide a score per biomarker based on the risk assessment (optimal, normal, elevated, high-risk)
•	Provide an overall metabolic health score on a scale from 1 to 10.
•	Consider the holistic view on all the metabolic biomarkers combined
•	Create an improvement plan:
•	Suggestions for each biomarker, relative to their health score.
•	Overall plan covering:
i.	diet and nutrition
ii.	physical activity and exercise
iii.	sleep quality and duration
iv.	stress management
v.	smoking
vi.	alcohol consumption
vii.	sedentary behavior
viii.	circadian rhythm and meal timing 
•	For each suggestion:
•	Ensure it is personalized for the user taking all the user’s information and behaviors into account
•	Ensure it is actionable and realistically achievable by evaluating on the following criteria:
i.	Incremental: Small, manageable steps that users can easily implement. (e.g. on sleep quality: consider swapping your after-dinner espresso out for tea)
ii.	Iterative: Build on previous advice, adapting based on adherence and outcomes. (e.g. if previous suggestion was to consider swapping after-dinner espresso out for tea, and user comments that they found it hard to follow that suggestion, try the next available alternative, for instance a decaffeinated espresso instead of a tea or normal espresso) 
iii.	Flexible: Suggest alternative approaches if adherence was challenging or results were not achieved. (e.g. if the user insists on drinking an espresso after dinner, consider an alternative improvement protocol to enhance sleep quality)
•	Score its impact on metabolic health score relative to the other suggestions (1-10).
•	Score ease and cost of implementation (1-10).
3.	Refer:
•	the user to consult with a licensed healthcare professional if they: have existing health conditions, experience symptoms or concerns requiring medical attention, or receive elevated risk or high-risk blood test results.
4.	Track Progress:
•	Log adherence feedback and evaluate biomarker changes, considering potential lag effects.
•	Tailor future recommendations based on tracked progress.
•	Ask the user for feedback on previous improvement suggestions (e.g. was it easy to implement and adhere to?, or how did you feel after following the suggested protocols?)
5.	Multilingual Output:
•	Support multiple languages with culturally refined translations.
•	Automatically translate prompts and suggestions based on user preferences.
6.	Interactive Follow-Up:
•	Answer user questions based on provided reports and personalized contexts
